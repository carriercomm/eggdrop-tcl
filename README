These are Tcl scripts I wrote for the Eggdrop (http://eggheads.org) botnet I maintained for a few years. I began them in 2002 and stopped updating them around 2004. I'm proud of the functionality I achieved with them and some of the clever (albeit naive) methods I used to get certain tasks done. They also serve as a good lesson in bad coding practices: the abundance of one-letter variables, virtually no commenting, and redundant functions across files. And I didn't even mention feature creep.
